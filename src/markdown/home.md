Hello!  I am an accessibility engineer working in higher education.  I have been learning, teaching, and practicing digital accessibility full time for over two years now.  I am going to start blogging to maintain my IAAP CPWA ([International Association of Accessibility Professionals Certified Professional in Web Accessibility](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpwacertification)) certification.  

Outside of the digital world, Iâ€™m a mom and a Girl Scout leader.  On the weekends, I am usually hiking or planning my next Girl Scout meeting.  

This site is using my [accessible Gatsby theme for blogging](https://github.com/slynch-a11y/gatsby-theme-a11y-blog).
