Hello!  This site is under construction.  I am an accessibility engineer at Yale University.  I have been learning, teaching, and doing digital accessibility full time for two years now.  I am going to start blogging to maintain my IAAP CPWA (International Association of Accessibility Professionals Certified Professional in Web Accessibility) certification.  

Besides being an accessibility engineer, Iâ€™m also a mom and a Girl Scout leader.  On the weekends, I am usually hiking or planning my next Girl Scout meeting (after cleaning and grocery shopping, that is).  

This site is using a Gatsby theme that I created (still a work in progress).
