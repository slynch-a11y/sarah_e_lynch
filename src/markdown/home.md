Hello!  This site is obviously under construction.  I'm an accessibility engineer at Yale University.  I have been doing digital accessibility full time for two years now.  I'm still a newbie and constantly learning.  I am going to start blogging to maintain my IAAP (International Association of Accessibility Professionals) CPWA (Certified Professional in Web Accessibility) certification.  If you are an accessibility expert and find an error in any of my articles, please let me know. I would love feedback!

Besides being an accessibility engineer, Iâ€™m also a mom and a Girl Scout leader.  On the weekends, I am usually hiking or planning my next Girl Scout meeting (after cleaning and grocery shopping).  

This site is using a Gatsby theme that I created (still a work in progress).  

Stay tuned!
