Hello!  This site is under construction.  I am an accessibility engineer in higher education.  I have been learning, teaching, and doing digital accessibility full time for two years now.  I am going to start blogging to maintain my IAAP CPWA ([International Association of Accessibility Professionals Certified Professional in Web Accessibility](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpwacertification)) certification.  

Besides being an accessibility engineer, Iâ€™m also a mom and a Girl Scout leader.  On the weekends, I am usually hiking or planning my next Girl Scout meeting (after cleaning and grocery shopping, that is).  

This site is using my [accessible Gatsby theme for blogging](https://github.com/slynch-a11y/gatsby-theme-a11y-blog).
