Hello! I am a design system engineer and a Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA). I enjoy learning and implementing accessibility in the digital world. I blog to maintain my CPWA certification through IAAP ([International Association of Accessibility Professionals](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpwacertification)).

Outside of the digital world, Iâ€™m a mom and a Girl Scout leader. On the weekends, I am usually hiking or planning my next Girl Scout meeting.

This site is using my [accessible Gatsby theme for blogging](https://github.com/slynch-a11y/gatsby-theme-a11y-blog).
